The purpose of this project is to document how to make Raspberry Pis suitable
for industrial uses.

This is mostly about hardening the operating systems,
such as Raspbian and Ubuntu. 
Most of this will be prose,
but scripts and other stuff to automate hardening are desirable.

Release early, release often.
